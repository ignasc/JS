# JS
JS basics from FreeCodeCamp

Simple template in each file:


PROBLEM, presented in the challenge
--------------------------------------------
TEST CASES, that can be used to test the code and make sure it works for different cases
--------------------------------------------
SOLUTION - code that I wrote to solve the problem above.


P.S. The code is not necesarily optimized or anything like that. I might come back to it every now and then to update as I learn and get more familiar with JS.
There is also some comments or variables names in Lithuanian language, so keep in mind that.
